# PathFinder
### Objective
> The objective of this project is to implement and visualize two popular pathfinding algorithms, Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* (A-star), on a grid. The system allows users to interactively set start and end points, as well as obstacles, and then visualize the shortest path between the start and end points using the selected algorithm.
